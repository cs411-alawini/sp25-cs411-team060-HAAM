## Project Summary
Our project consists of a medical diagnostic tool that aims to utilize Natural Language Processing to help users easily diagnose their illness symptoms by comparing them to a reference set of data stored within our database. The user will select from the body where their issue is and/or input keywords aligning with their issues (eg. Nausea, Swelling, Bruising, etc.) and using data scraped from proven sources, such as Mayo Clinic and WebMD, SympChat can quickly provide possible diagnostics and remedies. By allowing the user to save their past illness records and update with the official doctor diagnosis, future cases with similar conditions will become more accurate, and the user will effectively have access to a personal health log. This tool is aimed towards less tech savvy audiences who aren't familiar with AI tools and deep web searching. We plan to make an easy to use simple interface that will allow young children to easily figure out their cuts and scrapes and headaches if home alone. We plan on using Rake to handle the keyword extraction and processing, and React.Js for the frontend. For the heat map visualization there are variations of Python packages that we will select.
